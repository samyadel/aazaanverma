			"This project involved rebranding the 'Shi-Tuan' chili oil line, a fusion of Ghanaian Shito and Chinese Szechuan flavors, for a UK-wide launch. The design process blended cultural elements from both Ghana and China through carefully chosen colours, typography, and imagery. The result is a cohesive, visually appealing label that communicates the product’s unique fusion, while maintaining cultural dignity. The final trio of labels, each distinct yet unified, exceeded client expectations and beautifully represents the brand’s essence with elegance and vibrancy.",

			"Though the music behind the project was never released, the album cover stands as a visual narrative of its own. Commissioned by an emerging artist, the design captures the themes of time's passage and the fading beauty of the past. Through careful composition and evocative imagery, the cover reflects the conceptual depth the artist envisioned, resonating with the listener before the music ever plays.",

Drawing on the intrigue surrounding the pyramids and various conspiracy theories, the piece explores the unknown, blending ancient symbolism with modern visual storytelling.

Starting with pencil sketches of rigid figures, I refined the positioning and movements to capture dynamic, lifelike stances.

			"For this project, I recreated a 1:1 scale model of the Olympus Trip 35 camera in SketchUp. Precision and accuracy were essential, as the model was designed to be true to scale, with all details carefully replicated. Despite limitations in textures and colors due to using the free version of the software, the model maintained a high level of fidelity. If rendered for 3D printing, it would produce a precise, to-scale physical version of the camera.",
