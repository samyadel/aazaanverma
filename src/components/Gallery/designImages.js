			"This project involved rebranding the 'Shi-Tuan' chili oil line, a fusion of Ghanaian Shito and Chinese Szechuan flavors, for a UK-wide launch. The design process blended cultural elements from both Ghana and China through carefully chosen colours, typography, and imagery. The result is a cohesive, visually appealing label that communicates the product’s unique fusion, while maintaining cultural dignity. The final trio of labels, each distinct yet unified, exceeded client expectations and beautifully represents the brand’s essence with elegance and vibrancy.",

Precision and accuracy were essential, as the model was designed to be true to scale, with all details carefully replicated. Despite limitations in textures and colors due to using the free version of the software, the model maintained a high level of fidelity. If rendered for 3D printing, it would produce a precise, to-scale physical version of the camera.",
